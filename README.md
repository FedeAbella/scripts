# Shell scripts

Just a collection of shell (mostly bash) scripts I use for git, waybar, etc.

Feel free to use any, but note you may need to modify some stuff to make it work
for you. Nothing is guaranteed to work. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Scripts are organized _somewhat_ around use:

- `arch`: scripts for ArchLinux
- `git`: scripts for git
- `hypr`: scripts for [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)
- `sf`: scripts for [the Salesforce cli](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)
- `waybar`: scripts for [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
